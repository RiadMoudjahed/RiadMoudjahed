# 👋 Hi, I'm Riad Moudjahed

**Cybersecurity Analyst** | **Blue Team Focus** | **19 🇩🇿**

I **build** things, **break** things, and **write** about them. Currently working as a **Project Manager** for Security Awareness Training at **CyberTronic Solutions** while completing 35+ hands-on **SOC labs** and **reverse engineering** challenges.

## 🔧 What I Build

### 🏠 [SOC Home Lab Environment](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Networking/Full%20SOC%20Analyst%20LAB%20%26%20Network%20Configuring.md)
Enterprise-grade security operations center built with **VMware, pfSense, and Wazuh SIEM**. Simulates real-world threat detection, network segmentation, and SPAN port mirroring for forensic analysis.

### 🚪 [Backdoor Activity Analyzer](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/tree/main/SIEM/Backdoor%20Activity%20Analyzer)
Developed Python-based log analysis tool to detect C2 beaconing patterns and persistent backdoor connections through temporal pattern recognition across 10-minute and hourly time windows.

### 🦠 [Malware Reverse Engineering Lab](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/Keylogger_MalwareAnalysis_Lab)
Created structured malware analysis lab with 15+ guided questions covering hash identification, static analysis (entry points, imported functions), and dynamic analysis (PCAP traffic, scheduled tasks).
### 🛡️ [SQL Injection Prevention Demo](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Vulnerability%20Management/SQL%20Injection%20Prevention%20Demo.md)
Built vulnerable and secure Python login systems to demonstrate **OWASP Top 10** exploitation and mitigation using parameterized queries and bcrypt authentication.

### 🔍 [Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Vulnerability%20Management/Basic%20Vulnerability%20Analysis%20With%20Nessus.md)
Full-lifecycle vulnerability management: scanning, CVE prioritization (CVSS scoring), and remediation planning for simulated infrastructure.
