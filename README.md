# 👋 Hi, I'm Riad Moudjahed

**AI Security Specialist** | **SOC Analyst** | **Blue Team + AI Red Team** | **19 🇩🇿**

I **build** AI security tools, **break** LLMs, and **write** about both. Currently working as **Project Manager** for Security Awareness Training at **CyberTronic Solutions** while completing **35+ SOC labs**, **22 AI red team challenges**, and open-sourcing security automation tools.

## 🤖 AI Security Projects

### 🎯 AI Red Team Lab Series
**Built 22 hands-on labs** teaching LLM adversarial attacks across **4 difficulty tiers** (Easy → Expert). Covers prompt injection, jailbreaking, model manipulation, guardrail bypasses, and advanced evasion techniques for GPT, Claude, and Llama models.

### 🛡 [ModelGuard](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/ModelGuard)
A comprehensive security analysis tool that scans AI/ML models for malicious code, backdoors, and security vulnerabilities. It uses advanced detection techniques including entropy analysis, pattern matching, and optional AI-powered deep analysis via local Ollama for 100% privacy.

### 🔍 [AI-Powered PCAP Analyzer](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/AI-Powered-PCAP-Analyzer)
Automated network threat detection using **Ollama LLMs + Scapy**. Analyzes packet captures with AI to detect DDoS, port scans, and suspicious patterns. Tested on **11K+ packets** — identified DDoS attack (56% traffic concentration), extracted IOCs automatically, generated actionable security reports.

### 🚪 [LLM-Powered Backdoor Analyzer](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/tree/main/SIEM/Backdoor%20Activity%20Analyzer)
Python tool combining **Isolation Forest ML** (92% accuracy, 67% fewer false positives) with **Ollama LLM analysis** for intelligent C2 detection. Processes **15K+ logs in <3 seconds**, generates natural language threat reports explaining findings in SOC analyst terms.

## 🔧 Traditional Security Projects

### 🏠 [SOC Home Lab Environment](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Networking/Full%20SOC%20Analyst%20LAB%20%26%20Network%20Configuring.md)
Enterprise-grade SOC infrastructure with **VMware, pfSense, Wazuh SIEM**. Real-world threat detection, network segmentation, SPAN port mirroring for forensic analysis. **35+ completed labs** covering incident response, threat hunting, and SIEM rule creation.

### 🦠 [Malware Reverse Engineering Lab](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/Keylogger_MalwareAnalysis_Lab)
**15+ guided exercises** teaching static/dynamic malware analysis with **Ghidra, dnSpy, Wireshark**. Custom keylogger sample for hands-on learning: hash identification, PE analysis, PCAP inspection, IOC extraction.

### 💉 [SQL Injection Prevention Demo](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Vulnerability%20Management/SQL%20Injection%20Prevention%20Demo.md)
Live exploitation + mitigation demo for **OWASP Top 10**. Vulnerable vs. secure Python login systems showing parameterized queries and bcrypt authentication.

### 🔍 [Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Vulnerability%20Management/Basic%20Vulnerability%20Analysis%20With%20Nessus.md)
Full vulnerability management lifecycle: scanning, CVE prioritization (CVSS scoring), remediation planning for simulated infrastructure.
