# 👋 Hi, I'm Riad Moudjahed

**AI Security Engineer** building security frameworks for LLMs and RAG systems. I design end-to-end security programs for production AI systems—from red teaming and vulnerability assessment to operational controls, incident response, and compliance. Currently building complete RAG security engineering framework, 22 AI red team labs, ModelGuard ML scanner, and AI-powered security tools. Looking for remote AI Security Engineer opportunities.

## 🤖 AI Security Projects

### 🎯 AI Red Team Lab Series
**Built 22 hands-on labs** teaching LLM adversarial attacks across **4 difficulty tiers** (Easy → Expert). Covers prompt injection, jailbreaking, model manipulation, guardrail bypasses, and advanced evasion techniques for GPT, Claude, and Llama models.

### 🛡 [ModelGuard](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/ModelGuard)
A comprehensive security analysis tool that scans AI/ML models for malicious code, backdoors, and security vulnerabilities. It uses advanced detection techniques including entropy analysis, pattern matching, and optional AI-powered deep analysis via local Ollama for 100% privacy.

### 🔍 [AI-Powered PCAP Analyzer](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/AI-Powered-PCAP-Analyzer)
Automated network threat detection using **Ollama LLMs + Scapy**. Analyzes packet captures with AI to detect DDoS, port scans, and suspicious patterns. Tested on **11K+ packets** — identified DDoS attack (56% traffic concentration), extracted IOCs automatically, generated actionable security reports.

### 🚪 [LLM-Powered Backdoor Analyzer](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/tree/main/SIEM/Backdoor%20Activity%20Analyzer)
Python tool combining **Isolation Forest ML** (92% accuracy, 67% fewer false positives) with **Ollama LLM analysis** for intelligent C2 detection. Processes **15K+ logs in <3 seconds**, generates natural language threat reports explaining findings in SOC analyst terms.

## 🔧 Traditional Security Projects

### 🏠 [SOC Home Lab Environment](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Networking/Full%20SOC%20Analyst%20LAB%20%26%20Network%20Configuring.md)
Enterprise-grade SOC infrastructure with **VMware, pfSense, Wazuh SIEM**. Real-world threat detection, network segmentation, SPAN port mirroring for forensic analysis. **35+ completed labs** covering incident response, threat hunting, and SIEM rule creation.

### 🦠 [Malware Reverse Engineering Lab](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/Keylogger_MalwareAnalysis_Lab)
**15+ guided exercises** teaching static/dynamic malware analysis with **Ghidra, dnSpy, Wireshark**. Custom keylogger sample for hands-on learning: hash identification, PE analysis, PCAP inspection, IOC extraction.

### 💉 [SQL Injection Prevention Demo](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Vulnerability%20Management/SQL%20Injection%20Prevention%20Demo.md)
Live exploitation + mitigation demo for **OWASP Top 10**. Vulnerable vs. secure Python login systems showing parameterized queries and bcrypt authentication.

### 🔍 [Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Vulnerability%20Management/Basic%20Vulnerability%20Analysis%20With%20Nessus.md)
Full vulnerability management lifecycle: scanning, CVE prioritization (CVSS scoring), remediation planning for simulated infrastructure.
