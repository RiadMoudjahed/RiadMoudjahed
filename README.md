# 👋 Hi, I'm Riad Moudjahed

**Cybersecurity Analyst** | Blue Team Focus | 19 🇩🇿

I build things, break things, and write about them. Currently working as a Project Manager for Security Awareness Training at CyberTronic Solutions while completing 35+ hands-on SOC labs and reverse engineering challenges.

## 🔧 What I Build

### 🏠 [SOC Home Lab Environment](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Networking/Network.md)
Enterprise-grade security operations center built with **VMware, pfSense, and Wazuh SIEM**. Simulates real-world threat detection, network segmentation, and SPAN port mirroring for forensic analysis.

### 🦠 [Malware Reverse Engineering Lab](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/Keylogger_MalwareAnalysis_Lab)
Analyzed custom keylogger using **Ghidra, dnSpy, and Binary Ninja**. Extracted IOCs, identified persistence mechanisms, and documented full analysis workflow. **[Read the report →](link)**

### 🛡️ [SQL Injection Prevention Demo](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Vulnerability%20Management/SQL%20Injection%20Prevention%20Demo.md)
Built vulnerable and secure Python login systems to demonstrate **OWASP Top 10** exploitation and mitigation using parameterized queries and bcrypt authentication.

### 🔍 [Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus](https://github.com/RiadMoudjahed/SOC-Analyst-Projects/blob/main/Vulnerability%20Management/Basic%20Vulnerability%20Analysis%20With%20Nessus.md)
Full-lifecycle vulnerability management: scanning, CVE prioritization (CVSS scoring), and remediation planning for simulated infrastructure.
