# 👋 Hi, I'm Riad Moudjahed

**Cybersecurity Analyst** | Blue Team Focus | 19 🇩🇿

I build things, break things, and write about them. Currently working as a Project Manager for Security Awareness Training at CyberTronic Solutions while completing 35+ hands-on SOC labs and reverse engineering challenges.

## 🔧 What I Build

### 🏠 [SOC Home Lab Environment](link-to-repo)
Enterprise-grade security operations center built with **VMware, pfSense, and Wazuh SIEM**. Simulates real-world threat detection, network segmentation, and SPAN port mirroring for forensic analysis.

### 🦠 [Malware Reverse Engineering Lab](link-to-repo)
Analyzed custom keylogger using **Ghidra, dnSpy, and Binary Ninja**. Extracted IOCs, identified persistence mechanisms, and documented full analysis workflow. **[Read the report →](link)**

### 🛡️ [SQL Injection Prevention Demo](link-to-repo)
Built vulnerable and secure Python login systems to demonstrate **OWASP Top 10** exploitation and mitigation using parameterized queries and bcrypt authentication.

### 🔍 [Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus](link-to-repo)
Full-lifecycle vulnerability management: scanning, CVE prioritization (CVSS scoring), and remediation planning for simulated infrastructure.
